# 🎁 Releases

**PLEASE READ**:

For the lack of a better name, I call it **Astralum**.

For older (official) versions, please refer to the [original MalumMenu repository](https://github.com/scp222thj/MalumMenu).

# ⬇️ Installation

The installation process is the same as for the original MalumMenu (see [here](https://github.com/scp222thj/MalumMenu?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-installation)).

Instead of downloading the latest ZIP or DLL release from the original repository, download it from this fork's releases section.

If you are using the DLL, make sure you have BepInEx 6.0.0-BE-735 installed. Older ones will not work.

Make sure you are only having one version of MalumMenu installed at a time, as having multiple versions can cause issues.
