    - **For Microsoft Store, Epic Games Store, or Xbox App:** Download `MalumMenu-VERSION-MicrosoftStore-EpicGames-XboxApp.zip`.

2. Open the zip file you have just downloaded and copy all its contents.

3. Paste these files directly into your Among Us game folder:
    - **Steam:** Right-click Among Us in your Library → Click `Manage` → Click `Browse local files`.
    - **Epic Launcher:** Right-click Among Us in your Library → Click `Manage` → Click the folder icon in the `Installation` box.
    - **Itch.io:** Open the Itch.io app → Right-click Among Us in your Library → Click `Manage` → Click `Open folder in Explorer`.
    - **Microsoft Store:** Open the location where Among Us is installed (usually under `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\` or another default path depending on your installation).

4. Launch Among Us as you normally would. You should see a console window appear, installing the mod's requirements.

5. Wait for the console window to finish the installation.

6. After installation, Among Us will automatically open with MalumMenu successfully installed.

  <summary><h2>❗ I'm having issues installing MalumMenu</h2></summary>

First of all, make sure you are running the most recent version of Among Us (`2026.2.24`) with the most recent version of MalumMenu (`v3.0.0`).

Also, check if your platform is officially supported:

- ✅ Steam
- ✅ Itch.io
- ✅ Epic Games Launcher
- ✅ Microsoft Store
- ✅ Xbox App
- ❔ Cracked (rarely works)
- ❌ iOS App Store & Google Play
- ❌ PS & Switch & Xbox Console

Now ensure that you have downloaded the correct zip file for your platform:
- For Steam or Itch.io: Download `MalumMenu-VERSION-Steam-Itch.zip`
- For Microsoft Store, Epic Games Store, or Xbox App: Download `MalumMenu-VERSION-MicrosoftStore-EpicGames-XboxApp.zip`

Make sure you followed the installation guide precisely. This is what your `Among Us` folder should look like after a successful installation:

<br>Some antiviruses might cause issues when installing the mod, so consider temporarily deactivating your antivirus if the game isn't booting after installation.

When installing MalumMenu for the first time, it will take **MUCH** longer than usual for the game to load. This is completely normal and expected behavior, so don't be alarmed if you have to wait a while. You can keep track of the installation progress through this useful BepInEx console window that pops up when you start the game:

  <summary><h2>👨‍💻 I want to contribute to this project</h2></summary>
  
To get started, I suggest you first learn about the basics of C# and Unity, since that's what Among Us is written in. There are plenty of tutorials out there to help you with that.

You should also learn about Github forking and pull requests, since you will need to use those to make any contributions to the project. [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) is the official documentation on the topic.

Then, I suggest you learn about Among Us modding in general. In this project, I use BepInEx and Harmony to patch the game, so I suggest you take a look at [this](https://docs.reactor.gg) great guide to learn how to work with those. 

Here are some other useful resources:

- The [Reactor](https://reactor.gg/discord) discord server
    - A great community of Among Us modders where you can ask questions and get help
    - Here you can also find the most recent decompiled Among Us assemblies (the DLL files in `#resources` channel). I suggest using [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy/releases/latest) to go through these.

- [sus.wiki](https://github.com/roobscoob/among-us-protocol)
    - Useful resource to learn more about the Among Us network protocol 
    - Keep in mind that both it is slightly outdated
